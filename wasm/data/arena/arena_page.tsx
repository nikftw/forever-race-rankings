// The build arena: every build the sim can be given, ranked, computed ahead of time.
//
// The live rankings page runs one preset per spec in your browser and takes about forty
// seconds to do it. That is the ceiling of what a browser can be asked for, and it is a long
// way short of a leaderboard: the gear sets and rotations already in the repository multiply
// out to hundreds of builds. So those run headless in CI instead, and this page renders what
// they produced - instantly, with no sim in the browser at all.
//
// Which makes the cache question answer itself. The results file is the cache, the commit
// that produced it is the key, and the workflow that regenerates it on every push to master
// is the invalidation. Nothing has to notice the sim changed; the only thing that ever
// writes the file is a run that happened afterwards.

								Every build here was simulated: a character is assembled, given a talent build, a gear set and a rotation, and run against the
								same target for {formatToNumber(results.iterations)} iterations. What comes out is the average damage per second of those runs.
								Nothing is estimated, interpolated or predicted - each row is the outcome of that build being played out five thousand times.
							</p>
							<p>
								The gear sets and rotations are files in the repository, written by people. The talent builds are the community ones from each
								spec's own page, plus whatever a search found on top of them. All of it runs headless when the sim changes, and the site ships
								the results, which is why the table is instant and why nothing is simulated in your browser.

						<div className="arena-intro-block">
							<h2 className="arena-intro-title">Where AI comes into it, and where it does not</h2>

								<strong>Not into any number on this page.</strong> The damage figures come from a simulator - the{' '}
								<a href="https://github.com/wowsims/classic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

								</a>{' '}
								engine, forked and adjusted for Forever. It is ordinary code doing arithmetic on the client's own data tables. No language model
								produces, adjusts or estimates a DPS figure, and the talent search is a hill climb that measures builds rather than reasons
								about them.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Into the code, heavily.</strong> This sim's Forever changes, the talent search, this page and most of what surrounds
								them were written by an AI assistant working to one person's direction. That is worth saying plainly, because it is exactly the
								situation where confident-sounding output is cheap and being wrong is easy.

								So the checking is the point rather than an afterthought. <a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>Every ability the sim registers</a>{' '}
								records where its numbers came from, and a test refuses to let one be added without that. The <strong>rests on a guess</strong>{' '}
								column on the right carries it through to here: it is how much of a build's damage depends on something nobody has confirmed.
								Where those numbers came out wrong, they came out wrong visibly - which is the only version of this that is worth publishing.

					<ul className="arena-notes">
						<li>
							<strong>Every build meets the same conditions.</strong> One target, one encounter length, one buff set, one consumable list for its
							role. That is what makes two numbers comparable - the live <a href={`${SITE_BASE}dps_rankings/`}>rankings page</a> achieves the same
							thing by putting everyone in one raid, which stops being possible at this count.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The consumables are the arena's, and they did not used to be.</strong> Every spec brought its own list from its own test
							file, and the gaps were not small ones: both paladins and the feral tank had their weapon imbue commented out entirely, while
							warrior, hunter, rogue and tank warrior carried Windfury. Stripping the warrior's imbues costs it 14.2% - so this table was
							reporting a 19.6% gap between warrior and retribution while handing one of them a weapon buff and the other a bare weapon. It is
							2.3% now, and the difference was never about the specs. Each row says which list it drank.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Three lists, not one.</strong> Elemental Sharpening Stone is +2% melee crit and -2% <em>ranged</em> crit, so a single list
							for all fifteen would equalise the shopping and quietly tax the only spec that shoots. Within a role the list is identical - the
							same shopping list, not the same benefit, which is why Mighty Rage Potion stays in the melee list even though only warriors can
							spend it. What a class grants itself is not a consumable and is left alone: an enhancement shaman keeps Windfury Weapon and a rogue
							keeps its poisons. Equalising those took 23.6% off the shaman, which is not a shaman measured fairly, it is a shaman disarmed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Item level is the filter, not the file name.</strong> This table used to compare every spec on its "launch" gear set, on the
							grounds that launch is the one tier they all have. They do all have one - and those sets run from item level 63.1 to 70.0, which is
							most of a tier of difference sitting inside a table claiming to compare specs. A balance druid's launch gear is seven levels below a
							feral tank's. So gear is a number on every row now and a bracket above them, and the line under the filter says how far apart the
							rows you are looking at actually are.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Rests on a guess</strong> is what the build's damage is made of, not a verdict on it. Each ability is weighted by its share
							of that build's damage and looked up in the <a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>evidence manifest</a>. A build ten DPS ahead means
							something different if a quarter of it is unconfirmed. Hover the bar for the breakdown.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Gear and rotations come from what is already here</strong> - the sets and priority lists on each spec's page. Nothing
							invents a better rotation than the ones people have written down, so a spec with one rotation on file gets one rotation ranked. That
							is a gap in the data, not a finding about the spec.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Talents are searched, because they cannot be enumerated.</strong> A warrior has <strong>89,776,730,783,606,094</strong>{' '}
							builds it could actually spend - counted from the trees, enforcing rank caps, row gates and the prerequisite arrows. Legality is not
							what stands in the way: the arrows cut the count about fourfold, and what is left is two billion years of simulating at a second a
							build. Nor does throwing out the builds nobody would run. Count only the all-or-nothing ones, every talent maxed or untouched, which
							is roughly the shape of an optimal build, and a warrior still has 57,341,667 and a mage 1,261,940,421 - eighteen months and forty
							years. So each spec's best known build is improved one point at a time instead: price every point that could come out, price every
							point that could go in, make the best trade, repeat until no single move helps. Rows marked{' '}
							<span className="arena-found">found by search</span> came out of that, and hovering one shows its talent string.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>What that does and does not promise.</strong> It climbs from every distinct build the spec has on file rather than only its
							best one, because a climb goes to the nearest peak and one start reports the nearest peak to one build. Several starts agreeing is
							the cheapest evidence available that the peak is not merely nearby - it is still not proof that nothing higher exists somewhere else
							in the tree. It also only knows what this sim models: a talent flagged as unimplemented is worth zero here, so the search will
							happily empty it, and that is a fact about the sim rather than advice. Every build it reaches is checked against the game's own
							rules first - rank caps, row gates and prerequisites - so nothing in this table is a build you could not actually spend.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A build that does not spend 51 points says so.</strong> One does: the mage Frost community build spends 49, so every Frost
							number on this site has been two points short of a character. It is left as written rather than quietly corrected - it is somebody
							else's build - but the searched row beside it shows what those two points are worth.
						</li>
						<li>
							Tank specs are measured on damage alone and healing specs are absent, because damage is the only axis this table has. A protection
							paladin at the bottom is not a bad tank - and a searched tank build is a tank build with the mitigation optimised out of it, so read
							those two rows as what the spec can do to a target dummy and nothing else.
						</li>
						<li>
							Computed from sim <code>{results.commit ? results.commit.slice(0, 7) : 'unknown'}</code> on {generated.toISOString().slice(0, 10)}.{' '}
							{stale ? (
								<strong className="arena-stale">
									The site has been rebuilt since, so these numbers are older than the sim running on the rest of the site.
								</strong>
							) : (
								'That is the sim this site is built from.'
