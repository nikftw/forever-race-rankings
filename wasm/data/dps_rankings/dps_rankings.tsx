					The beta client was datamined on 17 September, and the numbers here come from its own data tables rather than from BlizzCon tooltips: build
					1.60.1.69913, read against Classic Era and diffed spell by spell. Talent values come from the client's rank curves, coefficients from the
					spell tables, and each rank is scaled to level 60 by the client's per-level points. 41 abilities still carry a number the client does not
					settle and 143 have not been classified; they are listed one line each in the{' '}
					<a href="https://github.com/ElliotWood/Forever/blob/master/docs/forever_beta_checklist.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
						beta re-verification checklist
					</a>
					, and every one of them can move a number in this table.
				</p>
				<p className="dps-rankings-provenance-body">
					This is an unofficial fork, not the official Forever sim, and the table is a self-check: run every build under identical conditions and a
					build the sim is getting wrong stands out. That is what it has been for. It is how the feral cat was found stuck at 398 with eight gear
					slots empty, the enhancement shaman re-dropping one totem until it ran out of mana, and the retribution paladin carrying a Holy Strike
					invented at nearly three times its published damage. Each of those is now fixed and written up in the{' '}
					<a href={`${SITE_BASE}changelog/`}>changelog</a>.
				</p>
				<p className="dps-rankings-provenance-body">
					There is a second limit under the first one, and the client does not lift it. Downranking is the clearest case: the client carries the full
					spell power coefficient on low ranks where Classic Era carried a reduced one, so read as written a rank 4 Lightning Bolt does most of a rank
					10 for a quarter of the mana, which is what the elemental rotation on this table does. Whether Forever removed that penalty or applies it
					somewhere the data does not show changes every caster here. The same goes for proc chances the client leaves unset and for combat rules that
					live on the server rather than in a table.
				</p>
				<p className="dps-rankings-provenance-body">
					So: do not pick a main off this table, and do not quote it as a Forever balance claim. It is a place to catch the sim getting something
					obviously wrong, and it is still that even now the client has settled most of the inputs - a rotation nobody has tuned and a rule the data
					does not carry will both show up here as a spec in the wrong place.

					All {this.builds.length} builds are simulated <strong>together, as one {this.builds.length}-player raid</strong>: one run, one encounter,
					one set of buffs, so every number in this table comes from the same fight. Those {this.builds.length} players span {specCount} specs.
					Running each build on its own would give numbers that cannot honestly be put side by side, because each spec's own defaults differ.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each player is a <strong>community talent build</strong> on its spec's raid preset - the gear, consumes and rotation the raid picker drops
					into a slot, with the build's talents in place of the preset's. Two builds of one spec therefore differ by talents alone; the presets are
					shared defaults, not per-build optimised gear or rotations, and some specs' presets are better tuned than others.

					) : (

					)}
				</li>
				<li>
					Every build wears its spec's <strong>Launch</strong> gear set: the best pre-raid gear in the launch item pool, picked by that spec's own
					stat weights, with raid drops left out. Same tier, chosen the same way, so the table compares specs and not gear.
				</li>
				<li>
					Raid buffs, party buffs and debuffs are the strongest of what each launched spec's own sim assumes by default, given to everyone alike, so
					nobody is missing a buff it expects. Blessings come from the paladins actually in the raid; innervates and power infusions are off, because
					nobody in the raid is casting them. <strong>No world buffs</strong>: they do not work inside Forever raids.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Rests on a guess</strong> is not a verdict on the build, it is what the build's damage is made of. Every action it performed is
					weighted by its share of that build's damage and looked up in the <a href={`${SITE_BASE}evidence/`}>evidence manifest</a>, which covers the
					talents, buffs, debuffs and item procs as well as the spells. The figure is everything neither settled from data, seen happen, nor a plain
					weapon swing - white damage is weapon damage times attack speed, which is the oldest arithmetic in the sim and has no manifest entry to
					have. Two builds a hundred DPS apart mean different things if one of them runs its rotation through three unconfirmed numbers and the other
					does not. It is deliberately a composition and not a score: collapsing the tiers into one figure would need weights nobody can defend.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every run is a fresh simulation in your browser at the iteration count below. Fewer iterations means a noisier comparison; raise it if two
					specs are close.
