 * behind. Removing 61 of 62 copies of a name has not removed it.
 *
 * Whole strings only. A plain substring replace turned "Murloc Streamrunner" into "Player
 * Streamrunner", because "Murloc" was itself a scrubbed name. Matching includes the length
 * prefix and the trailing NUL, so only a complete string can match.
 *
 * Same length, because the file has offsets in it that were never worked out; changing a
 * string's length risks moving something another part of the file points at.
 *
 * Throws rather than returning a file with a name still in it.
